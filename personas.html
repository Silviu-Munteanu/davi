				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Smart John is a very valuable member of the team of data scientists at Google. He got promoted to a senior two years ago and is trying to convince his company to let him take charge in the development of very important projects. However, to do that he needs to prove that he really undersands when a certain model is more or less suited for the dataset so he needs to make a lot of relevant visualizations. Not only that but he needs to be fast. Every moment spent on visualizing the data is less time for his model to train and to be validated. He also needs to share the result with his co-workers. He is very familiar with websites like Kaggle and would be able to code using different frameworks in order to make complex visualizations of the data, but that would take more time.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
            1. Before starting to make a model based on time series he first wants to visualise all the data too see if there is at least a somewhat visible pattern.
			2. In order to choose between two models: one that is more robust to outliers and one that is more sensitive he needs a reprezentation of the varience in the data.
            3. After validating some models, he wants to visualize some complex metrics of those models side by side on a plot.

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p> Conscientious Sarah is a young statistician that is very passionate about the more complex details of the data. However since she is more comfortable with theoretical notions than practical it is hard for her to create visualizations, even though she was taught in college to interpret them. Now she has to fulfill this too if she wants to keep her job.

			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
            1. Presenting the correlation between inflation and profits to her superiors with the help of visualization.
			2. Needing an intuitive way to estimate if her calculations fit the real life data or there is something that seems to be off.

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p> Nerdy Dimitre is a student in Iasi at Faculatea de Automatica si Calculatoare (AC). He likes to learn about new things that people are not that interested in normally. If the main goal of the average user is either to sharpen his/her skills in a domain with random datasets or to provide for a company with a personal dataset, he may just stuble across this website in search for some information regarding economic, politic or social statistics. He may boast about this achievement with his friends.
		</div>
		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
            1. He is bored and needs to feel productive so he searches for datasets that provide better and faster understanding through visualization;
            2. There is a chance that he may become interested in machine learning/statistics therefore becoming a primary persona in the future;

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Traditional Joe does not believe in change or improvement. As long as his shop is still standing he is happy, therefore he does not believe that interpreting data will help him in any way. He needs a place to store the sale history of his shop so there is a backup source but he does not like the interface provided by other websites or is afraid that they are going to steal his data. His only goal is to see his dataset listed in a nice way.

		</div>
		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
            1. After hearing about big companies stealing information, he decided to change the place for his data backups, choosing this website because it is made by less influential people.
			2. Since he values aesthetic things, he does not want to use websites with just Excel like interface, so he uses this site for the interface.
            3. He does not want to spend money on other sites that require payment.
