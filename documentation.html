<h3>User flow:</h3>
 See the figma file for visual user flow.
 The user first gets directed to the main screen where the main datasets are. Here he clicks any one of those or clicks show more for more, less searched for, datasets are shown. He can also import his own dataset or search for more using either the keyboard or vocal search. The login/sign up feature is implemented mainly for posting datasets online and saving the imported ones, so the user is not forced to login if none of this actions interest him. After searching for a dataset he can view the documents regarding that dataset, download them, share, report or copy link. He can also see similar datasets. For each document he can view he can firstly choose the type of visualization he would like to see, click show graph and customize it with filters or zoom in.
<h3>Storyboards:</h3>
 See the figma file for the storyboard.
<h3>Affective factors & emotion:</h3>
    The simple architecture avoids the cognitive overload therefore offering a more calming sensation. The color pallete used is comprised of only 3 colors which is much less noisy than an approach with a lot of different colors, while still being enough for sufficient contrast in order for elements to be easy to find. The color palletes avoid colors that are too bright and that may cause fatigue yet the 2 of the 3 colors are quite lively.
    Green simbolizes vitality and/or wealth and orange simbolizes energy, enthusiasm and creativity.</br>
    The rounded corners of the buttons adpot a modern style and offer a feeling of comfort through the lack of sharp edges. </br>
    Datasets having images associated makes for easier memorization of existent datasets and makes the website and community seem more friendly. </br>
    The ability to choose between light and dark mode allows the user to customise the website depending on his/her needs, contributing to the user's comfort. </br>
